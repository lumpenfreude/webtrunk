***it's like webfinger but less gross***

node.js webfinger resolver docker image thingamajig based on silverbucket's [node-webfinger-service](https://github.com/silverbucket/node-webfinger-service), [this webfinger library thing here](https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/common-code-webfinger-library/657/5) and also a bit on [ReverentGeek/blog](https://github.com/reverentgeek/blog). i hope it works! no guarantees because i am a python freak when it comes to your higher level languages and haven't really done anything with node! whoops!
